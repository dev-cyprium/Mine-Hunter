# Mine Hunter

## About
Minehunter is a game inspired by Minesweper that you can play in your browser. It
was made ~~in 6 hours as a fun project.~~ In the end, it took me a week to complete it and polish out the bugs.

## Features
 * Fully functional online clone of Minesweeper
 * Compete online with other users to get the best time.

## Specs
This application was made in Ruby on Rails.
Note: It's a side project to test what I've learned so far on the great [Odin project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)

## How to play
The goal is to uncover all the mines on the game board and to do it in the least amount of time possible.
In order to help you, cells with mines around them are displaying a counter to show you exactly how many mines
are in a 8x8 grid around that cell.
